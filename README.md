# Pipboy-Fallout4
This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a web-based Pipboy application. The project is a part of web development course.
The Pipboy interface serves as a dashboard with tabs for "STATUS," "SPECIAL," and "PERKS," providing an immersive experience reminiscent of the Fallout video game series. The responsive design is achieved using Bootstrap, and the application includes visual elements such as status bars, icons, and level progress indicators.
